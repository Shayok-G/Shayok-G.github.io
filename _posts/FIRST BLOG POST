Welcome to the first of many posts on my blog! I’m using this space to explore the features of this website builder through GitHub and to share updates from my professional journey. Here, I’ll post lab reports, essays, and insights from extracurricular projects, including online courses, work experiences, and other ventures I’ve taken on. I hope to utilise this blog to display the growth of skills through various endeavours that I will undertake.
