## Academics and University Interests
I will be using this to make updates on current work I am engaged with, as well as current developments beyond my formal study; such as updates on the latest work emerging from universities and other research insitutues. By documenting and engaing with these pieces of work, I hope to broaden and deepen my knowledge of these fields before making my decisions in future careers. By doing this I hope to display my intellectual curiosity, which is essential for success in the life sciences.
